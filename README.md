# Program Overview
- This program implements the graph data structure with an array based implementation. Utilizing both the stack and queue data structures for graph traversals.
- Solves the "Traveling Salesman" problem using the brute force algorithm.

## Output
- Output is written in sample_data/output.txt
- All "valid" paths are shown. Valid meaning there is a path that starts and ends at the correct city.
- The best path is the one with the lowest weighted sums on its path.
- The "cost" in this instance is measured with a fixed fuel efficiency of 40mpg.
